# Solar-Radiance---Nasa-Power

Analysis of the solar radiance at one point using the NASA POWER API.
The API from Nasa, NASA POWER, provides accurate data about the winds, temperature and solar radiance around the globe since the 80's.

In this Notebook I create a function to collect the solar irradiance at one point using the API, and created a database with these informations.
This could be helpful to companies working with photovoltaic solar energy, predicting the incidence of solar radiation in one house or region.

Things to do:

- Time serie analysis
- Predict the solar radiance using KNN (or other algorithm)
- Plot the information on a Map (choroplet Map or something related)
